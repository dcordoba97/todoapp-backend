# Functionality

The project is still WIP so the avaliable features we have are:

## CRUD endpoints

This will agilize the way we work with the front-end since the API is already there awaiting our requests.

## Delete task

If needed, when looking through your tasks you can decide to delete the desired item.

## Edit Task

(WIP) Forgot to add something to your task? Click on edit to help you out

## Search box

(WIP) Need to search for said item? Get a quick search with the search box. Use the filters as you may need.

## Sort by parameter

(WIP) Sort by the desired parameter from the bottom of the table with just a click

## Metrics Box

(WIP) Displays the average time for tasks to be done and also displays the average time filtered by priority

## Pagination 

(WIP) Displays a fixed amount of tasks so we don't overload your browser.
